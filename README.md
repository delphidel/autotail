# Autotail

Tell your story to "Workers United Facts" with the help of internet.

You must have an OpenAI API Key to automatically generate "stories". Set 

```OPENAI_API_KEY=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```

or use your own. This key is approved to spend up to $20. I've only been able to spent $0.06 so far with a few instances running in parallel, so go to town.


### Install

```pip install .```

### Run
```autotail -h```
to see available CLI arguments.

To run forever without the browser opening, use

```autotail --relentless```
